# Copilot Instructions for AI Coding Agents

## Project Overview
This project appears to be a practical exercise or demo by Javier Armesto, focused on supporting a wide range of image and design file formats. The workspace contains static files (`index.html`, `README.md`, etc.) and a data file (`temps.json`).

## Key Files
- `index.html`: Main entry point for the web interface.
- `README.md`: Contains supported formats and contact information.
- `temps.json`: Likely used for storing temporary or configuration data.
- `markdown.md`, `README.html`: Additional documentation or alternate formats.

## Supported Formats
Refer to the `README.md` for a comprehensive list of supported file formats, including complex design files, raster images, raw photos, and animated formats. This is central to the project's purpose.

## Developer Workflows
- No build scripts, test suites, or automation detected. All files are static and can be edited directly.
- For documentation, update `README.md` and `markdown.md` as needed.
- For data changes, edit `temps.json` directly.

## Project Conventions
- Markdown is used for documentation, but some comments suggest limited Markdown expertise.
- No custom code patterns, frameworks, or external dependencies are present.
- All integration points are static or manual (no API calls or dynamic backend detected).

## Example Patterns
- To add a new supported format, update the relevant list in `README.md`.
- To change the UI, edit `index.html`.
- To update configuration or temporary data, modify `temps.json`.

**If you need to automate, refactor, or extend functionality, clarify requirements with the user, as the project is currently static and documentation-driven.**
